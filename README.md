 There are 4 difference button that's send GET request on API Every Button using different Method to send the 'GET Request'                   
   1. XHR     = XMLHttpRequest,

   3. jQuery  = $.getJSON().
   4. Axios   = axios()
   
  XML Http Request:-
        You can use XHR for send the request but the problem is it's lot of code you have to write and if you are wroking on large Application that have a lot of data so it's pretty hard to manage if you are using XHR.
    
  Fetch Request:-
        Fetch request is easy to using and it's use JS Promises. But if you want to use fetch() you also have to Parse you data on JSON and there is a nice way of doing this is .json() Method in fetch Request.One last point you need to make sure that's browser support right know IE is not supporting fetch().
        
  jQuery ajax:-
        jQuery is allow you to make your code less and do more that's mean there provide different method to send the request all the method that jquery provide are using XML Http Request some of the jquery API method are:-
        $.ajax()
        $.get()
        $.post()
        $.getJSON()  and you also have to include jQuery in your script.
   
  Axios request:-
        You can a request API using axios this is a simple library that allow you send request and you don't need to parse you data to json format axios do it for you and you can use this on backend as well support by all browers but you need to include it on you code.
